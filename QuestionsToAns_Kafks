Consumers can join a group by using the samegroup.id.

Online :The maximum parallelism of a group is that the number of consumers in the group ← no of partitions.
Arun : Partitions will be depening on topic .. there will a syntax available in the online .. you could see to find out 
docker run --net=host wurstmeister/zookeeper kafka-topics --zookeeper localhost:22181 --topic starcom.status --describe
above syntax will show you how many partitions are there for each topic 

Kafka assigns the partitions of a topic to the consumer in a group, so that each partition is consumed by exactly one consumer in the group.
--> Still i am having some questions over here .. read it ..

Kafka guarantees that a message is only ever read by a single consumer in the group.

Consumers can see the message in the order they were stored in the log.
