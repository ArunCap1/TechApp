Simple Socket programming:

As per my knowledge storing the data from one server to another server .. like connecting perticular system and under perticular port

#sending data to another system or transferrting the data from one system to another system through hostname and port number.


Checking the status of perticular server wether that server is running or not.. so many things we could do with socker programming.
